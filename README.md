# typomatic
A typographic automatic computer

## Overview
Any computation you can do, you can do using a kind of string-processing routine called a [Markov machine](https://www.ihes.fr/~fenyes/typomatic/introducing.html#computation). Typomatic is a tool for automatically running Markov machines. It's [easy to use](https://www.ihes.fr/~fenyes/typomatic/introducing.html#typomatic), fun to watch, and super engaging.

If you want to teach an introduction to computer science, and you&rsquo;re looking for a simple and awesome model of computation, might I recommend Markov machines? I think they&rsquo;re a really natural way of looking at computation, and my students have enjoyed using Typomatic to explore the set of computable transformations.

## Getting started
Typomatic is a [web application](https://www.ihes.fr/~fenyes/typomatic/typomatic.html) that runs in your browser. You can save the application page and use it offline.

The [intro page](https://www.ihes.fr/~fenyes/typomatic/introducing.html) explains [how Markov machines work](https://www.ihes.fr/~fenyes/typomatic/introducing.html#computation) and [how to use Typomatic](https://www.ihes.fr/~fenyes/typomatic/introducing.html#typomatic).
